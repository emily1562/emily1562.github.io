My name is Emily Le. I am Vietnamese Chinese American and apart of the first generation Asian American my family. I have a mom, dad, and a sister. I am the youngest child of the two with me and my sister being 5 years apart (Fun Fact! My older sister, Chelsea and I have the same birthday. We also have milestone birthdays too!).  During my free time, I love to eat, sleep, binge watch TV shows, play tennis, and listen to music.
